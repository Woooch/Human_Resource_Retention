### Description
"HR data can be hard to come by, and HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano and I set out to create our own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of our graduate MSHRM courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of Business. We created this data set ourselves. We use the data set to teach HR students how to use and analyze the data in Tableau Desktop - a data visualization tool that's easy to learn." (Dr. Rich, Kaggle)

## Take away
- Using R at a high degree is more difficult than I thought.
- I didn't achieve the desired accuracy score during my model implementation, my experiment provided an accuracy of 65% using a logistic regression model.
- However, I did come to some conclusion from my test that of the many factors that decide an employee's decision, the most impactful factors are
  - Salary
  - Projects
  - Engagement
  - These factors make sense in everyday life as we transition to different jobs because of money and/or we like to do something different.
